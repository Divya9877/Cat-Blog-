# Cat-Blog 🐾

This is a simple static HTML project titled *Mr. Whiskers' Blog*, created to showcase basic web development skills. The webpage features a welcoming header, a brief "About" section, multiple blog-style posts about Mr. Whiskers' adorable adventures, and a contact section. It uses clean and semantic HTML5 elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`, making it an ideal beginner-friendly project for learning the structure of a personal blog website.
